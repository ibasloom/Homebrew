------------------------
Let's start by opening a special program on your Mac called "Terminal". It's like a magic box where you can give your computer special instructions.


1. Go to your Applications folder.
2. Inside that, look for a folder called "Utilities".
3. Inside "Utilities", you'll find an app called "Terminal". Double-click to open it.

------------------------

1. Copy this command:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. Go back to the Terminal, and right-click with your mouse or trackpad. You'll see an option that says "Paste". Click on it.
3. After you've pasted the command, press the "Return" key on your keyboard. This will tell your computer to start the installation process.
